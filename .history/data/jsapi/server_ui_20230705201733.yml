  It is possible to interact with the UI by sending messages from server side scripts. This messages
  can tell the UI to perform different actions, like navigate to a view, reload the UI, show a message
  or trigger an action.

  There are a few important things you need to take into account when working with UI messages:

  - Even though you can call this method from any script we recommend to use it only on scripts that are
    associated to views, like event scripts in views. This makes it more clear when they will be executed.
  - If you call this method from a script that is not associated to a view (for example, an action script)
    the message might not be sent to the UI and will be lost. For example if the action is executed in the
    background or the action is executed as part of another process that isn't UI related (like an external
    REST API call).
  - You can send multiple messages to the UI and they will be executed in order. However it is important to
    understand that some messages could discard others. For example if you reload the page, any message after
    that command will be lost.
  - Messages might not be sent to the UI immediately; that's implementation-specific based on the features
    available at the UI. UI messages might be executed only when the request has been completed.

  All messages have at least two fields:

  - `scope`: indicates what's the scope of the message and which elements in the UI should process them.
    Currently there are three, `global`, `view`,  `plugin` and `action`.
  - `name`: this is the name of the message. It is unique inside each scope.
  - `target`: this is used to define the message addressee. The possibles values are *caller*: the user who
    initialize the ui request, *users* send the message to all users defined in targetUsers in all their tabs
    and *allUsers* a broadcast. Default value is *caller*.
  - `targetUsers`: addressee list just when target users is defined. It is an array of emails or ids. The default
    value is the current user.
  - `views`: this is a list of view names. It is only required on the scope `view`.
  - `recordId`: this is a list of view names. It is only required on the scope `view`.


  Then each message could default additional options. Here is the list of available messages:
