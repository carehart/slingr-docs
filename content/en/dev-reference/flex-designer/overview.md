## **Introduction**

The Flex designer allows to create views with a custom layout using different widgets that enhance the user experience.

## **General rules**

The following list outlines the rules that must be adhered to in all flex layouts:

- There cannot be empty rows or empty columns.
- Widgets can only be dragged into columns.
- All widgets must be configured before applying changes.
- Columns cannot be placed into other columns.

## **Quick start**

The flex designer comprises [available widgets]({{<ref "/dev-reference/flex-designer/categories.md">}}), which can be dragged and ordered to construct the flex view.
