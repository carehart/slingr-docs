Shortcuts available in the flow designer:

- **`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`F`**: Toggle fullscreen mode.
- **`Shift`+ `Click, Hold & Drag`**: Draw a multi-selection area.
- **`Escape`**: Remove any active multi-selection. Also, removes the selection of the selected step and collapses the properties panel.

## **Steps multi-selection**

It is possible to select several steps or an entire flow at once by using the above shortcut. This is useful for quickly relocating the flow or a portion of it, as demonstrated in the image below:
