## **Definition**

Steps are predefined components that serve specific functionalities. They are used in a flow to create code in a more graphical way, eliminating the need to learn any specific coding language. Instead, you simply need to drag and drop steps from the steps palette onto the canvas area and then connect them by dragging a connector from a source step to a target step. Steps are categorized, and documentation for each step can be found on the following pages.

## **Categories**

### System

The first category of steps is labeled "System". Here, you'll discover steps that aid in constructing your flow. For instance, you'll find the logger step, which logs information to your application's monitor, and the set var step, which creates a new variable in the context. The steps in this category include: start, end, logger, script, and set var. Documentation for each of these steps can be found on the following pages.
