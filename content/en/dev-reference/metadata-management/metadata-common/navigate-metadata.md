## **Metadata navigation pop-up**

To swiftly navigate through your metadata within the builder, press the key combination `ctrl` + `shift` + `f`. This action will open the metadata navigation pop-up. Inside this pop-up, you'll encounter an input search box designed to seek out **`labels`** across all metadata in the application. The pop-up will then display a comprehensive list of matches found. Clicking on any of these search results will automatically redirect you to the view of the selected resource.
