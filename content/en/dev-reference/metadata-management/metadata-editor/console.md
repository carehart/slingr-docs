## **Console panel**

Situated at the bottom of the app builder is the **`console`** panel. By clicking on it, you can expand this panel. Within the console, you have the ability to execute scripts using the [Javascript API]({{<ref "/dev-reference/scripting/overview.md">}}) of the platform. The results of these script executions will be displayed on the right side of this panel. This feature proves highly valuable for testing scripts prior to implementing them in other parts of your app.
