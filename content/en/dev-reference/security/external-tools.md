## LastPass

LastPass is a password manager that stores encrypted passwords online. LastPass comes with a web interface, but also 
includes plugins for various web browsers and apps for many smartphones.

> There are cases where the application performance can be affected by external factors and here we try to give you some advice.

If you are using the LastPass extension in Chrome and notice that the performance is not good you can:

1. Go to edit the settings for your site by clicking on the LastPass plugin in the upper right corner and then 
   clicking on the edit pen icon. Then expand the advanced settings tab and check disable autofill. Save the changes 
   and reload the page.

2. Right-clicking on the LastPass extension icon go to options. Then select the notifications tab and deselect 
   "Show autofill icon in fields" and "Show notifications via browser toolbar icon". Save the changes and restart the browser.
   
3. If the problems persist after the previous configurations. Disable the LastPass extension. In Chrome go to 
   "More tools" and then "Extensions". Deactivate the LastPass extension.
