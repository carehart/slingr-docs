Flex views enable you to display the content of a record or action with a custom layout. You can specify which fields are shown, override default display options and create complex layouts following row/column standard.

### Supported view types

Among the views that can be configured as flex, the platform currently supports two types:

- **[Flex action views]({{<ref "/dev-reference/user-interface/flex-views/flex-action-views">}})**
- **[Flex record views]({{<ref "/dev-reference/user-interface/flex-views/flex-record-views">}})**
