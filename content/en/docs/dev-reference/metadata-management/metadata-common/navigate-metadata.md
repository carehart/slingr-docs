In the builder, pressing the key combination `ctrl` + `shift` + `f`  will open the metadata navigation pop-up. You will see an input search box that will look for **labels** of any metadata in the application and display a list of all the matches. Clicking on one of these results will redirect you to the view of that selected resource.
