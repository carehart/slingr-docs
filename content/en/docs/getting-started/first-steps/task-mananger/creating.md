Once you are logged into the developer portal, you should see the Home Page:

1. Click on the `New App` button in the section Your Apps.
2. Fill in the app label and name. The name must be unique on the platform.
3. Select `Slingr Free` as the plan for your app.
4. Select the option to start from scratch.
5. Wait until the app is created. This takes a minute to complete.

Once your app is created you will see its details. By default, you will be the owner of the app and you will have developer permissions for the development environment, which is created by default.

In the details of the environment you will be able to navigate through the different components of the app:


- `Go To App`: it will take you to your running app. Right now it doesn’t make much sense because we haven’t done anything yet, so it’s empty.
- `Monitor`: from there we can see the app's status, background jobs, logs, etc. If you need to know what’s going on, this is the place to look at.
- `Builder`: this is where we will develop our app.

You can also see the different environments and components on the Apps Page.

The first button is the Runtime, the second the monitor, and the third one the builder. 
As our new app is empty, the first thing we need to do is to go to the app builder, by clicking on the builder button (the one with the wrench). That will automatically open the builder in a new tab.
