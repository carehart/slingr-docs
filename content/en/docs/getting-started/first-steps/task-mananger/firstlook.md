Hey, welcome back. In this section, we are going to take a first look at the app we have been working on. Right now, we have a very basic app set up but don't worry, we will keep working on it. For now, let's take a look at what we have done.

Your view should look something like this. In the top right corner, click `Create`, complete the form and click `Create`. You are going to see a read-only view like this one.

To go back to the table you can click the element on the sidebar or the link `All Tasks` at the top left corner of the view.

On this page, you will be able to create new tasks, see and edit existing ones, as well as delete them. You can also filter tasks using the listing headers, and export and import records. Awesome right? All this has been created automatically from your app definition.
I know that our app is pretty basic right now, but stick with me in the next section we are going to add some actions to our entity, so we can change the status of a task without having to go inside the edit view. For now, let's just go to the builder tab or open it through the developer portal and I'll see you in the next section ll
