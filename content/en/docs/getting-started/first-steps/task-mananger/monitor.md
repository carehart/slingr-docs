We are done with the development of the app, but it is good to mention that you can see whatâ€™s going on in your app on the app monitor.
To access the app monitor you should click on the `Monitor` button (the one with the eye) on the developer portal.

On the monitor, you can have information about your running apps. For example, you can see the logs of your app in the `Logs` section:

Also, you can manage the users of your app, from the section `Users`:

The monitor is really useful, check out the different features that it has. Hopefully, you have learned a lot about slingr during this tutorial. Now is your turn to build something great!
