In this section, we are going to see how the actions which we implemented in the previous section are working. 

As you can see in the grid view, a new column called `Actions` has been added. You can execute the actions from there or from these places:

![Alt Text](/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/t.png)

![Alt Text](/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/tt.png)

![Alt Text](/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/ttt.png)

Awesome! We have our actions running. Review that the preconditions are working as expected. Also, inspect that in the edit view, the status can not be changed. 
I hope everything is working as expected, if not, read the previous section to see if there is something you miss. 
That's it for this section, in the next one, we are going to create a new type of view that will work perfectly with what we are doing. If you want to learn more, let's go to the next section .
