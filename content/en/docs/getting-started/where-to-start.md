Welcome to Slingr, in this page we are going to talk about how to get started with Slingr. But first of all, you may be wondering What is Slingr? Well, Slingr is a platform to create cloud apps that can easily integrate with other SaaS solutions out there. [You can learn more about what Slingr here](../../getting-started/what_is_slingr). Also, If you want to understand a bit better how the platform works, take a look [here](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/platform-overview.html).

Once you understand a bit better what Slingr is, you should create a developer account. This will allow you to start creating apps and play around with the platform, which is the best way to learn to use it. The developer account can be created from the [Developer Portal sign up page](https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/signUp.html).

Once you have created your account, we recommend following these [tutorials](../../getting-started/first-steps/main/) that will guide you through the most important features and steps of creating apps in Slingr. While you do so you should take a look at the [Developerâ€™s reference](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/app-development-overview.html) to get more details about the different features available.

Also, we strongly recommend reading the following pages about the basics of app development with Slingr:

- [App development overview](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/app-development-overview.html)
- [Pushing and syncing changes](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/app-development-pushing-and-syncing.html)
- [Development process](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/app-development-development-process.html)
- [Automatic refactorings](https://platform-docs.slingr.io/app-development-automatic-refactorings.html)
