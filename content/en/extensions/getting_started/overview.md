## **What is extensions?**

Extensions are crucial for development, materializing through services and packages. These components offer flexibility and effectiveness in extending application capabilities. Developers, when utilizing extensions, can efficiently optimize and customize projects. Acting as foundational blocks, these extensions seamlessly facilitate connections with external APIs, authentication management, and key operations. By encapsulating specific solutions, extensions foster a collaborative and diverse ecosystem, driving continuous innovation and the creation of more robust, personalized solutions. In summary, extensions, supported by services and packages, are fundamental for the creation of modern and adaptable applications.

Services and packages are crucial components that extend the functionality of the Slingr platform.

ðŸ‘‰ [Service](/extensions/services/overview) is essentially a piece of software that operates alongside your app, providing additional features and capabilities.  For instance, you can implement an service that offers cryptographic algorithms, enabling your app to utilize them securely.

ðŸ‘‰ [Packages](/extensions/package/overview) are a convenient way to import a set of metadata into your application. In simpler words, a way to import a set of prebuilt functionalities. Their primary purpose is to streamline the implementation of predefined functionalities, saving developers a significant amount of time.

The services and packages integrate to interact with an external API, such as Mandrill. How do we achieve this? Very simply, the service, in this case, an HTTP service, contains the logic in Java or Node to establish the connection to the external service. In other words, it constructs the HTTP requests and sends them to the Mandrill API. Meanwhile, the Mandrill package provides authentication methods and functions with which the platform developer interacts to send requests to the endpoint. This will become clearer in the following diagram.

As you can see, Slingr processes multiple types of services and packages that will help you integrate with external APIs. On the other hand, you can develop your own services or packages, share them with the community, or keep them for personal use only. In the following entries, you will find information on how to install [services](/extensions/services/overview), [packages](/extensions/package/overview), or create your own using our [Java](/extensions/services/java-sdk), or [Node](/extensions/services/node-sdk) SDKs.
