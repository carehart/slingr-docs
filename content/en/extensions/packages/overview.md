## **What are packages?**

In Slingr, packages are a way to reuse code across apps. For example, a package can provide features to access another service's API (like Stripe, Slack or QuickBooks) by helping with authentication, data transformations, etc. Another common use case is for libraries, where they can offer a set of scripts with commonly used methods (encryption or math utilities, for example).

A wide range of official packages are available, designed to facilitate and enrich the development experience. In addition to the official packages, the platform encourages the creation and sharing of custom packages, enabling the community to benefit from specific solutions and collaborate in the growth of the development ecosystem.

By utilizing these packages, developers can expedite the development process, enhance efficiency, and build robust applications that leverage Slingr's capabilities. Whether integrating external services, adding new features, or sharing solutions with the community, packages become a key component in making the most of the versatility of the Slingr platform.
