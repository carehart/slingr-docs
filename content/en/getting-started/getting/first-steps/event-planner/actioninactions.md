In this section, we will explore how the actions implemented in the previous section work. To get started, follow these steps:

ðŸ‘‰ Go to the ``"All Events"`` view.

ðŸ‘‰ Click on a record to view its details. You should see the read-only view.

ðŸ‘‰ In the header, you will notice a new button labeled "More." Click on it to proceed.

ðŸ‘‰ Both actions should now be visible, but please note that you will only see them if the status of the event is "Active."

### Execute "Cancel event" action

ðŸ‘‰ Locate and click on the ``"Cancel Event"`` action. A confirmation popup will appear. Click on ``"Cancel Event"`` again to confirm the action.

ðŸ‘‰ Once the action has completed, the status of the event should be `Cancel`, and the actions should no longer be visible. It should look something like this:

### Execute "End event" action

ðŸ‘‰ Now let's select another active event to execute the other action. In the read-only view of the other event, click on `Actions`, and then on `End Event`.

ðŸ‘‰ A confirmation popup will appear, click on `End Event`. When the action completes, the status of the event should be `Done`. It should look something like this:

**That's it! We have finished this small tutorial.**

The purpose of this tutorial was to guide you through your first steps with Slingr. If you're interested, there's an additional section where we make a small improvement to our app.
