In this section, we will learn how to add actions to our events. The purpose is to enable changing the event status without entering the edit view. 

## Create a 'cancel event' action

Let's get started by creating an action to cancel events using a feature called ``Flows``. This action will only be visible when the current status of the event is set to Active. Follow these steps:

ðŸ‘‰ Right-click on the node `Model > Entities > Events > Actions` and select `New Action` from the dropdown menu.

ðŸ‘‰ Fill in the form with the following details:

       Label: Cancel Event
       Name: cancelEvent
       Type: One Record
       Visible: Always
       Preconditions: Expression
       Expression: Value > Status > Equals > Active
       Actions type: Flow

### Configure action flow

ðŸ‘‰ Click on Open Editor.

This is what we call the **``Flow Designer``**, and the boxes on the left are referred to as "steps." Each step has different functionality, and you can connect them to build a flow. You can learn more about flows [here]({{<ref "/dev-reference/flows/overview.md" >}}). We are going to use it to change the status of the record.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow these flow steps:

1. Create an "Update Record" step and connect it to the "Start" step.

2. On the right, fill the form to the following details:

```   
      Record: record
      Data: Status > Set > Cancel
      Store Changes: true
```

3. Create an "End" step and connect it to the "Update Record" step.

4. Click on Create.

**This is ready!**

ðŸ‘‰ When this action is executed that, the user will be able to set the status of an event to "Cancel" without having to edit the event record.

## Create a 'done' action

Now, the only thing left is to create another event to transition an event from "Active" to "Done." 

We can follow the same process we just learned, but this time, we will utilize the JavaScript API offered by Slingr. You can learn more about it [here]({{<ref "/dev-reference/scripting/overview.md" >}}).

Let's do it:

ðŸ‘‰ Right-click on the node ``Model > Entities > Events > Actions`` and select ``New Action`` from the dropdown menu.

ðŸ‘‰ Fill in the form with the following details:

       Label: End Event
       Name: endEvent
       Type: One Record
       Visible: Always
       Preconditions: Expression
       Expression: Value > Status > Equals > Active
       Actions type: Script
       Script:
         record.field("status").val("done");
         sys.data.save(record);

ðŸ‘‰ Click on Create.

ðŸ‘‰ Push to see the changes.

That's it! We have implemented our two actions. After pushing the changes, go to the runtime and proceed to the next section, **Actions in Action**, to see the results.
