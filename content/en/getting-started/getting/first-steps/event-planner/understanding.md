In this tutorial, we will work with the default app created for all Slingr developers, the "Event Planner" app. This application is created when you sign up for a new account and is designed to help new users understand the power of Slingr. If you don't have a Slingr account yet, you can [create one here](https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/signUp.html). 

Our goal in this tutorial is to make some small improvements to the existing event planner app, such as adding an extra field and some actions to enhance its functionality. But before we dive into the improvements, let's understand what our app currently does. 

As the name suggests, the app helps companies plan events and includes the following features:

- Creation, editing, and deletion of events, with the ability to view them in a table or a calendar format
- A To-Do board to help staff organize their tasks for events
- A section to upload services that can be used across all events
- Administration features for uploading customers and staff
- Metrics on previous events and customers

Sounds awesome, right? Let's make it even better. Check out the next section to see how!
