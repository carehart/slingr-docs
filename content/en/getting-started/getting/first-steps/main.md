The best way to learn how to use Slingr is to build something. Luckily for you, we have made some tutorials to help you get started. In these tutorials, we wonâ€™t go through all the features of the platform. The goal is that you get a general idea of how it works and then you can start building something great by yourself.

In these tutorials, we are going to assume you already have a developer account. If not, go ahead and <a href="https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/signUp.html">create one here</a>

If you just want to see the resulting apps, we have made them available as templates. So you only need to create an app [here](https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/login.html) and select the app that you want as a template. Keep in mind, that if you start the Task Manager App from a template, you will need to configure the Slack integration as explained in the section [Integration with Slack]() of the Task Manager tutorial.
