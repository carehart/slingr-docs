The best way to learn how to use Slingr is to build something. Fortunately, we have made some tutorials to help you get started. In these tutorials, we won’t go through all the features of the platform. The goal is that you get a general idea of how it works, and then you can start building something great by yourself.

In these tutorials, we are going to assume you already have a developer account. If not, go ahead and <a href="https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/signUp.html" target="_blank">create one here</a>

If you wish to explore the resulting apps without going through the entire process, we have provided some as templates for your convenience.

You can easily create an app [here](https://developer-portal.slingrs.io/login.html) and select the desired template from the available options. However, please keep in mind that if you choose to start the Task Manager App from a template, you'll need to configure the Slack integration as detailed in the "[Integration with Slack]()" section of the Task Manager tutorial.
