At this point, we have an app with some fantastic features up and running. However, you might desire a different design for a specific use case. Let's consider adding a workflow view to make our app look even more impressive. To provide you with a visual representation of what I mean, here's an example of how it would look:

### Create the workflow view

Isn't it awesome? Let's create the workflow view:

1. Right-click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Views`** and select **`New view > Workflow view`** from the dropdown menu.

2. Fill in the form with:
  - `Label`: Task Board
  - `Name`: taskBoard

3. Click on **`Create and edit`**.

---

### Add some card configuration details

Once the workflow view is created, its configuration details will appear. The first thing to do is to set up the card settings:

1. In the **`Header`** setting, select **`Script`** and add the following code in the function's body:
  ```
  return 'Task #' + record.field('number').val();
  ```
<br>

2. In the **`Summary`** setting, leave **`Field`** selected, and in the **`Summary field`** select **`Title`**.

3. Click on **`Apply`** to save changes.

### Create a rank field

Before defining the columns, we need to add a new field to the entity that will be necessary to enable ranking of records:

1. Right-click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Fields`** and select **`New Field`**.

2. Fill in the form with:
  - `Label`: Rank
  - `Name`: rank
  - `Type`: Rank

3. Click on **`Create and edit`**.

4. Go to the **`Display options`** tab.

5. Set the option **`Visible`** to **`Never`**. This is to hide this field as we donâ€™t want to show it to our users. We will only use it internally to keep the rank of tasks.

6. Click on **`Save`** to save changes.

### Create the view columns

Now we are ready to create the columns in the workflow view

1. Click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Views > Task board > Columns`**.

2. Click on the **`Create`** button on the top-right of the page.

3. Fill in the form with:
  - `Label`: `To do`
  - `Filters`: `Status` equals `To do`

4. Set the flag **`Allow to rank records`** and select the field **`Rank`** in **`Rank field`**.

5. Click on **`Create`** to save the column.

Repeat the same process to create these two additional columns:

| Label        | Filters                                        |
| ---          | ---                                            |
| In progress  | **`Status`** equals to **`In progress`**       |
| Done         | **`Status`** equals to **`Done`**              |

<br>

### Define transitions

Once you have the columns we need to define the transitions that will allow moving a card from one column to another:

1. Click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Views > Task board > Transitions`**.

2. Click on the **`Create`** button on the top-right of the page.

3. Fill in the form with:
  - `Label`: Start work
  - `Source column`: To do
  - `Target column`: In progress
  - `Action`: Start work (tasksStartWork)

4. Click on **`Create`** to save the transition.

Repeat the same process to create these other transitions:


| Label              | Source column | Target column | Action                   |
| ---                | ---           | ---           | ---                      |
| Complete           | In progress   | Done          | Complete (tasksComplete) |
| Stop work          | In progress   | To do         | Stop work (tasksStopWork)|
| Reopen from done   | Done          | To do         | Reopen (tasksReopen)     |

### General improvements to the view

We are almost there! Let's do a few improvements:

1. Click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Views > Task board > CRUD actions > Tasks`**.

2. For **`Create`**, **`Read`** and **`Update`** set the flag **`Open in modal`** to **`active`** and click on **`Apply`**. This will allow the opening of tasks in a modal.

3. Click on the node **`Model > Entities > Tasks > Views > Task board`**.

4. Inside **`Menu settings`**, in the setting **`Record menu`** select **`Some`**.

5. Then in **`Record menu actions`** click on **`Add`** and select the action **`Archive (tasksArchive)`**. This is to be able to archive tasks because we didnâ€™t create a column for the **`Archived`** status to keep this view clean.

6. Finally, click on **`Apply`** to save the new changes.

### Add the view on the interface navigation

1. Click on the node **`User interface > Navigation > Main menu`**.

2. Click on the **`Add new menu entry`** button on the top-right of the page and select **`Add view entry`**.

3. Fill in the form with:
  - `View`: Task board
  - `Label`: Task board
  - `Icon`: select the one you like the most!

4. Click on **`Create`** to save the menu entry.

Great! We are done. I know this section was difficult so thanks for sticking with it. 

Now let's just **`push the changes`** and open the runtime tab. 

[In the next section](/getting-started/getting/first-steps/task-mananger/workflowview/), we are going to see the changes we have made.
