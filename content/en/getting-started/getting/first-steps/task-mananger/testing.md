In this section, we will examine the functionality of the actions we implemented in the previous section.

## Discover the actions

As you can observe in the grid view, a new column called "Actions" has been added. You can execute these actions from the "Actions" column or from the following locations:

### From "All tasks" view actions column

![Actions Column]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/t.png)

### From "All tasks" view main menu

![All tasks main menu actions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/tt.png)

### From task record view main menu

![Task record main menu actions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vendor/task-mananger/testing-actions/ttt.png)

Great! Our actions are now running. Please verify that the preconditions are working as expected. Additionally, ensure that in the **`edit view`**, the status cannot be changed. If you encounter any issues, refer back to the previous section to see if there is something you might have missed.

Thatâ€™s it for this section. In the next one, we will create a new type of view that complements our current implementation. For more information, proceed to the next section: **"Creating a workflow view."**
