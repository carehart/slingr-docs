Pricing of the platform is based on apps. Each app will have a corresponding subscription, which can be associated with any of the three products we offer:

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Free:`** These apps are free and won't incur any charges.

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Dev:`** These apps have a fixed monthly fee. [You can check the pricing here](https://www.slingr.io/pricing).

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Pro:`** These apps will be charged based on usage. The more environments, instances, endpoints, etc., you use, the more you will pay. [Please check the pricing here](https://www.slingr.io/pricing) for more details.

It's essential to note that although you see monthly prices on our website, we bill hourly. This means that your end-of-month payment may not be exact, but it will be similar. This benefits you because you only pay for what you use. For example, if you need to spin up an app for testing purposes, you can create one, perform the necessary tests, and then delete it, and you will be charged only for the time you used it.

Keep in mind that Slingr offers additional services like support and professional services that are not part of the platform billing scope. You can find more information about them on the [Slingr website](https://slingr.io).
