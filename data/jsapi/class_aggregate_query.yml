  Allows to build aggregate quieries easily. Here you will find information about the methods
  provided by this class. If you want to understand how to use and write aggregate queries, please check
  the documentation on [Aggregate queries]({{<ref "/dev-reference/queries/aggregate-queries.md">}}).

  Usually you will create query objects using the method `sys.data.createAggregateQuery()`
  instead of using the constructor directly.
