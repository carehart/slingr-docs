  Execute an action over one record.
request:
  description: |
    If the action contains parameters, you can send them in the body. The format is the same as when you create
    or update records, but instead of fields you should send parameters of the action.

    If the action doesn't have parameters you can leave the body empty.
  headers:
  parameters:
    - name: entityName
      default:
      required: yes
      description: Name of the entity the record belongs to.
    - name: id
      default:
      required: yes
      description: ID of the record to execute the action on.
    - name: actionName
      default:
      required: yes
      description: The name of the action that has to be executed.
    - name: _async
      default: false
      required: no
      description: |
        Indicates if the action has to be executed in the background, which is needed if the execution is going
        to take more than 30 seconds.

        When setting this parameter to `true` the response of this method will be a reference to the job in charge
        of executing the action.

        This parameter will override the default configured in the action.

      "param1": "value",
      "param2": value
    }

response:
  description: |
    The response will be different based on the type of action and the parameter `_async`. There are three
    possible responses:

    - Record: if the `_async` parameter is `false` and the action doesn't return any custom response, then
      the updated record is returned by this method. This only applies for actions of type `One record`.
    - Custom action's response: if the `_async` parameter is `false` and the action returns a custom response, then
      that response is returned.
      Keep in mind that actions of type `Many records` should always return a custom response. If they don't
      return anything, an empty response will be returned.
    - Job reference: if the `_async` parameter is `true`, the method will return a reference to the job in charge
      of the execution of the action. Once the action is completed you will find the response of the action
      in the results of the job.

    You can find samples for each type of response below.
