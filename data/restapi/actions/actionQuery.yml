  Execute an action over records matched by a query.
request:
  description: |
    If the action contains parameters, you can send them in the body. The format is the same as when you create
    or update records, but instead of fields you should send parameters of the action.

    If the action doesn't have parameters you can leave the body empty.
  headers:
  parameters:
    - name: entityName
      default:
      required: yes
      description: Name of the entity the records belongs to.
    - name: ids
      default:
      required: yes
      description: IDs of records to execute the action on separated by commas.
    - name: actionName
      default:
      required: yes
      description: The name of the action that has to be executed.
    - name: _async
      default: false
      required: no
      description: |
        Indicates if the action has to be executed in the background, which is needed if the execution is going
        to take more than 30 seconds or if it is applied over more than 1,000 records.

        When setting this parameter to `true` the response of this method will be a reference to the job in charge
        of executing the action.

        This parameter will override the default configured in the action.
    - name: query parameters
      default:
      required: no
      description: |
        These are the query parameters. See [Query language]({{site.baseurl}}/app-development-query-language.html) for
        more information.

  description: |
    The response will be different based on the type of action and the parameter `_async`. There are three
    possible responses:

    - A map with records: if the `_async` parameter is `false` and the action doesn't return any custom response,
      then a map with the ID of the records as key and the JSON of the records as value will be returned. This
      only applies for actions of type `One record`.
    - Custom action's responses: if the `_async` parameter is `false` and the action returns a custom response, then
      a map with the ID of the record (for each record) as key and a map with the `status` ("ok" or "error") and `response` with the
      custom response will be returned.
      Keep in mind that actions of type `Many records` should always return a custom response. If they don't
      return anything, an empty response will be returned.
    - Job reference: if the `_async` parameter is `true`, the method will return a reference to the job in charge
      of the execution of the action. Once the action is completed you will find the response of the action
      in the results of the job.

    You can find samples for each type of response below.
