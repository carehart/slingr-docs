    The response will be different based on the parameter `async`. There are two possible responses:

    - Record: if the `async` parameter is `false`, then the deleted record is returned by this method.
    - Job reference: if the `async` parameter is `true`, the method will return a reference to the job in charge
      of the execution of the delete process. Once the job is completed you will find the response of the process
      in the results of the job.

    You can find samples for each type of response below.
