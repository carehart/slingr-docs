summary: Deletes all records matched by a query
description: |
  Deletes all records matched by a query. You won't be able to recover deleted records (except that you have enabled
  history for that entity).

  This method will return immediately but a job will be created to delete the records in the background. You can
  check the status of the job to verify when it finishes.

    - name: _async
      default: false
      required: no
      description: |

        to take more than 30 seconds or you want to delete more than 1,000 records.

        When setting this parameter to `true` the response of this method will be a reference to the job in charge
        of executing the deletion.
    - name: _lowPriority
      default: false
      required: no
      description: |

    The response will be different based on the parameter `_async`. There are two possible responses:

    - A map with records: if the `_async` parameter is `false`, then the result will be a map with the ID of the
      record as the key and the value will be a map with the fields `status` and `response` (the deleted record
      as a JSON) or errorMessage if there was an error.
    - Job reference: if the `_async` parameter is `true`, the method will return a reference to the job in charge
      of the execution of the delete process. Once the job is completed you will find the response of the process
      in the results of the job.

    You can find samples for each type of response below.
