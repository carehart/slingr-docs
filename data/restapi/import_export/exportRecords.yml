summary: Exports records to a CSV file
description: |
  Exports records to a CSV file. It is possible to filter records to export using a query and just export
  some of the fields.

  You can use the `_fields` parameter to indicate which fields should be included in the export. It works
  very similar as in [queries]({{site.base_url}}/app-development-query-language.html#select-fields-to-fetch),
  however there are a few differences:

  - You can put related fields, that is fields that are in the entities pointed by relationship fields. For
    example if you have a relationship field `company` pointing to the `companies` entity, you could specify
    the field `company.type` to be included in the CSV file. If you just put `company` only the label will
    be exported.
  - If you don't specify anything in `_fields`, all fields will be included, except related ones.
  - System fields (`id`, `label` and `version`) aren't included.

  parameters:
    - name: entityName
      default:
      required: yes
      description: Name of the entity the record belongs to.
    - name: _useFieldNames
      default: false
      required: no

        This flag modifies how headers are generated. If it is set to `true` it will use the name instead of the label
        to build the headers. Otherwise the label will be used, which is the default.
    - name: query parameters
      default:
      required: no

        These are the query parameters. See [Query language]({{site.baseurl}}/app-development-query-language.html) for
        more information.

    A reference to the job in charge of perform the import. To actually fetch the file you need to check when the
    job is finished and look into the results of the job, where you'll find something like this:

    ```js
    {
      ...
      "hasErrors": false,
      "results": {
        "fileLink": "https://docs.slingrs.io/dev/runtime/api/files/588f864eb45fc9000bc1bd5c",
        "fileId": "588f864eb45fc9000bc1bd5c",
        "recordsExported": 283
      },
      "status": "FINISHED"
    }
    ```

    The field `results.fileLink` contains the URL to download the file. You need to pass the token in the headers
    when fetching the file or the token needs to be set in cookies.
