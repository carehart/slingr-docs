summary: Force to stop a job
description: |
  When stopping a job it will try to do it gracefully. If the job keeps running and you need to stop it,
  you can force it, what will kill the job immediately.

  Keep in mind that the processing the job was doing might be interrupted and data might be in a bad state
  when doing this, so use it only for very special cases.
