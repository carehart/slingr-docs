fields:
  - path: id
    description: |
      ID of the job.
  - path: label
    description: |
      Name of the jobs. It is a simple description of what the job does. This description might change without notice
      so don't use it to take decisions in your code.
  - path: type
    description: |
      This is the type of job. There are many types of jobs, however some of them might change without notice. The
      only job types we support are the following ones:

      {{site.data.common.publicJobsDescription}}

      Other jobs are system ones and you shouldn't base your code on any of them as we might change or remove them.
  - path: runBy
    description: |
      It is a map with `id` and `fullName` of the user that triggered the job.
  - path: parentJob
    description: |
      It is a map with `id` and `label` of the parent job.

      The parent job is the job that was being executed when the job was created. If the job was not created during
      the execution of another job, then this field will be `null` and it means this is a root job.
  - path: rootJob
    description: |
      It is a map with `id` and `label` of the root job.

      A root job is one that doesn't have a parent. If this field is `null` it means this is a root job.
  - path: createDate
    description: |
      The date the job was created in milliseconds.
  - path: startDate
    descirption: |
      The date when the execution of the job started. This can be `null` if the job is still pending for execution.
  - path: endDate
    description: |
      The date when the execution of the job finished. This can be `null` if the job hasn't finished yet.
  - path: status
    description: |
      Current status of the job. It could be:

      {{site.data.common.jobsStatusesDescription}}
  - path: hasErrors
    description: |
      If `true` it means that there was at least one error during the execution of the job. You should check
      the logs and results of the job to see what happened.
  - path: progress
    description: |
      This is a number from 0 to 100 that indicates the progress of the job. Keep in mind that some jobs will move
      directly from 0 to 100 as there is no progress information. Also in cases were progress is updated it might
      not be consistent, so use it carefully.
  - path: recordsCount
    description: |
      If the job needs to do something with records, this number will indicate the number of records involved.
  - path: recordsProcessed
    description: |
      If the job needs to do something with records, this number will indicate the number of records that have
      been processed already.
  - path: childrenJobsCount
    description: |
      If other jobs were created during the execution of the job, this counter will increase to show how many children
      jobs have been created. This number will be 0 at the beginning but could grow over time, so it isn't fixed.
  - path: childrenJobsProcessed
    description: |
      The number of children jobs that are finished.
  - path: stoppable
    description: |
      If `true` it means this job allows to be stopped. Otherwise you won't be able to stop it and you need to wait
      for it (except that the job is still pending, case in which you can always stop it).
  - path: lowPriority
    description: |
      If `true` the job will be executed only when there are no many other jobs running.
  - path: data
    description: |
      The content of this field depends on the job. Here you will find more information about parameters for the
      job.

      {{site.data.common.jobsDataDescription || liquify }}
  - path: results
    description: |
      The content of this field depends on the job. Here you will find information about the results of executing
      the job.

      {{site.data.common.jobsResultsDescription || liquify}}
