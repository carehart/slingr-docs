params:
  - name: record
    type: sys.data.Record
    description: |
      This is the record that is being moved. You will usually update the rank field in this record
      using the methods in the [wrapper methods]({{<ref "/dev-reference/field-types/miscellaneous_types/rank.md#javascript-api">}})

      Keep in mind that you need to save the record after you update the rank field, otherwise rank won't
      be updated and record won't be moved.
  - name: recordBefore
    type: sys.data.Record
    description: |
      This is the record that is before the position we want to move the record. It could be `null`
      if we are moving the record to the first position so there is no record before.
  - name: recordAfter
    type: sys.data.Record
    description: |
      This is the record that is after the position we want to move the record. It could be `null`
      if we are moving the record to the last position so there is no record after.
