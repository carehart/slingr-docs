  description: |
    This is the format to display the year-month. Default is `yyyy-MM` but it can be changed to something else.

    There are a few predefined formats that are common, but you can choose `Custom` and define your own format
    based on the following rules:

    - Era designator: G (AD)
    - Year: yy (16), yyyy (2016)
    - Month: MMMM (July), MMM (Jul), MM (07)
restApi:
  readFormat: |
    The format is a string with the date in format `yyyy-MM`:

    ```js
    "nextHolidays": "2016-07"
    ```
  writeFormat: |
    You should pass a string with the date in format `yyyy-MM`:

    ```js
    "nextHolidays": "2016-07"
    ```
jsApi:
  readFormat: |
    The `val()` method in the wrapper will return a `Date` object.

    ```js
    // this will print something like "holidays: Thu Jun 01 2017 00:00:00 GMT-0000 (UTC)"
    log('holidays: '+record.field('nextHolidays').val());
    ```

    As the `Date` obect has day time, it will be set to `00:00` of the first day of the month using
    the time zone of the server.
  writeFormat: |
    When writing the value you could either use a `Date` object or use a string in the format `yyyy-MM`.

    ```js
    record.field('nextHolidays').val(new Date());
    record.field('nextHolidays').val('2016-07');
    ```

    If the value is not valid, the field will be set to `null` silently.

    You should pass the a string with the format `yyyy-MM`. For example:
    {{< query_sample
        id="sdfsad2343423423ppppppp"
        description="finds contacts with holidays in '2017-07'"
        entity="contacts"
        jsQueryMap="{'nextHolidays': '2017-07'}"
        jsQueryBuilder=".field('nextHolidays').equals('2017-07')"
        restApi="nextHolidays=2017-07"
    >}}

    When using the query builder you can use a `Date` object:

    ```js
    query.field('nextHolidays').equals(new Date());
    ```
