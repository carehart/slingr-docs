name: percentage
overview: |
  This type can store a percentage. It supports options for rounding and number of decimals.

  In the UI percentage values will be displayed multiplied by 100, wich makes more sense for humans when
  looking at the value. However at the code level, when using the REST or Javascript API, the value won't
  be multiplied. For example if the value is `50%`, then the value stored will be `0.5`.

  Right now this type does not support more than 2 decimals. This limitation will be solved soon.

typeRules:
- name: Minimum value
  description: |
    The minimum value (inclusive).
- name: Maximum value
  description: |
    The maximum value (inclusive).
- name: Limit decimals
  description: |
    Allows to limit the number of decimals. This will be done at the data level, so numbers will be stored in
    the database with the specified number of decimals and the rest will be lost. If you don't want to loose
    other decimals but still want to show less decimals, you should set these settings in display options.

    When you limit the number of decimals the following options will be displayed:

    - `Number of decimals`: this is the number of decimals to store. It can be from 0 to 2.
    - `Extra decimals action`: indicates what to do when there are more decimals than the limit. These are the options:
      - `Round`: uses rounding to limit decimals.
      - `Truncate`: truncates the trailing decimals.
      - `Throw error`: an error will be thrown if you try to set more decimals than it is allowed.
displayOptions:
- name: Show thousands separator
  description: |
    If this flag is set the thousands separator will be displayed in read-only mode. This flag has no effect
    in edit mode.
- name: Limit number of decimals
  description: |
    Allows to limit the number of decimals to show. This is at the UI level and doesn't have any effect on validation
    rules or when the number is stored in the database. For this reason this options are only taken into account in
    read-only mode.

    When you limit the number of decimals the following options will be displayed:

    - `Number of decimals`: this is the number of decimals to store. It can be from 0 to 4.
    - `Extra decimals action`: indicates what to do when there are more decimals than the limit. These are the options:
      - `Round`: uses rounding to limit decimals.
      - `Truncate`: truncates the trailing decimals.
restApi:
  readFormat: |
    The format is a number:

    ```js
    "availabilityRate": 60.7
    ```
  writeFormat: |
    You should pass a number:

    ```js
    "availabilityRate": 80
    ```
jsApi:
  readFormat: |
    The `val()` method in the wrapper will return a number:

    ```js
    // this will print something like "availabilityRate: 30.2"
    log('availabilityRate: '+record.field('availabilityRate').val());
    ```
  writeFormat: |
    You should pass a number to set the value:

    ```js
    record.field('availabilityRate').val(4.5);
    ```

    If you pass something that isn't a number, the field will be set to `null`.
exportImport:
  exportFormat: |
    The export format is a string with a decimal number:

    ```
    "percentageField1","percentageField2"
    "50","76.25"
    ```

    No symbol or thousands separators are in the number.
  importFormat: |
    The import format is a string with a decimal number:

    ```
    "percentageField1","percentageField2"
    "50","76.25"
    ```

    No symbol or thousands separators should be in the number.
