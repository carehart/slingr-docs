      <description>In this document, we present recommendations for creating a new app in Slingr. While you&amp;rsquo;re free to follow your own approach, we suggest going through this guide initially to grasp the fundamental path. You can then adapt these guidelines to your specific needs.
The process # At Slingr, we embrace agile methodologies for software development. The platform is designed to facilitate agile implementation while building apps. This means you can swiftly set up a basic app, and gradually evolve and enhance it over time.</description>

      <description>As described in the Overview, the configuration of your data model, business rules, scripts, views, permissions, etc., is collectively referred to as the metadata of your app.
To make changes to the metadata, you must use the app builder, which is accessible only in the development and staging environments. The production environment does not allow direct changes; instead, you need to synchronize changes (see below). However, you can adjust environment settings from the app monitor to customize behavior (more on environment settings below).</description>

      <description>As detailed in the Development Process, Slingr simplifies the adoption of agile methodologies for app development. Automatic refactorings are an instrumental feature in this regard, greatly facilitating the evolution of your app.
When you introduce changes to your app, we strive to propagate these changes systematically, minimizing the need for manual adjustments across multiple areas. The following are examples of automatic refactorings:
Field Addition: If you add a new field to an entity, the field will be automatically integrated into all managed views.</description>
