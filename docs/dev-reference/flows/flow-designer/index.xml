Navigate to the Builder section of your app. Look for a property that supports flows as an alternative. After selecting this option, an &amp;ldquo;Open editor&amp;rdquo; button should appear. The flow designer consists of three main panels: the step&amp;rsquo;s palette, the canvas, and the properties panel.</description></item><item><title>Establishing connections</title><link>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/establishing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/establishing/</guid><description>Flows consist of a sequence of steps interconnected in a specific direction. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand how to establish connections between these steps. In the flow designer, connections are created by dragging connectors from a source step&amp;rsquo;s endpoints to a target step or a target connection&amp;rsquo;s endpoint. The connection&amp;rsquo;s endpoints are the small colored squares located at the edges of the steps. They become visible once they are dragged onto the canvas.</description></item><item><title>Group container steps</title><link>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/group-container/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/group-container/</guid><description>Some steps in the flow designer also function as group containers. These group containers have the capability to hold nested steps within them. You can easily identify group container steps by dragging them from the palette and dropping them onto the canvas. Once dropped onto the canvas, you will notice that these steps are wider and taller than regular steps. They also display a &amp;ldquo;Dropped steps here&amp;rdquo; message in the center.</description></item><item><title>Validation rules</title><link>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/validation-rules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/validation-rules/</guid><description>Certain rules must be adhered to in order to successfully save a flow. If any of these rules are not followed after clicking the Apply or Save button, a validation error notification will appear, and the changes won&amp;rsquo;t be saved.
Rules # The flow name must be unique within the app. Each step name must be unique within the flow. Both a Start step and at least one End step are mandatory.</description></item><item><title>Keyboard shortcuts</title><link>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/keyboard-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>/dev-reference/flows/flow-designer/keyboard-shortcuts/</guid><description>Shortcuts available in the flow designer:
Ctrl+Alt+F: Toggle fullscreen mode. Shift+ Click, Hold &amp;amp; Drag: Draw a multi-selection area. Escape: Remove any active multi-selection. Also, removes the selection of the selected step and collapses the properties panel. Steps multi-selection # It is possible to select several steps or an entire flow at once by using the above shortcut. This is useful for quickly relocating the flow or a portion of it, as demonstrated in the image below:</description></item></channel></rss>
