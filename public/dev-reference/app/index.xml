      <description>In the app builder, under the App &amp;gt; Types section, you have the capability to employ predefined type rules and display options. This proves advantageous when you wish to maintain a consistent configuration across multiple fields in the app while managing it centrally in a single location.
By default, upon creating a new app, default display options are generated for all types. Consequently, when you create a new field, the type display options for that field are automatically configured to reference the default type display options.</description>

      <description>Certain scenarios require the upload of files that need to be accessible by anyone. A classic example is when you wish to include icons or images in emails.
Within the app builder, under App &amp;gt; Files, you have the capacity to upload files that can be accessed via a public URL. For instance, if you upload a file named logo.png into the images folder, you can retrieve it using the following URL:</description>

      <description>During the process of pushing changes, a crucial flag comes into play: Backup version. Activating this flag results in the creation of a backup for the version being pushed. This backup can subsequently be restored from the App &amp;gt; Versions section within the app builder.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that these backups exclusively encompass the app&amp;rsquo;s metadata; data itself is not retained in these backups. Furthermore, when changes are synchronized to the production environment, an automatic backup of that version is generated.</description>
