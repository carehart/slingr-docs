      <guid>https://pmslingr.github.io/dev-reference/flows/examples/update-tax-rates/</guid>
      <description>Summary # In this example, we demonstrate an action that dynamically updates the tax rate percentage based on the customer&amp;rsquo;s location. When the customer&amp;rsquo;s location is Colorado, the tax rate is set to 5%, while for customers in Arizona, the tax rate is adjusted to 6.5%. This showcases how you can use contextual information to make real-time adjustments and tailor processes to specific conditions.
Step: start # Inputs # No configuration required.</description>

      <description>Summary # In this example, we present an action that performs a comprehensive search for all companies located in Arizona. For each company found, it updates the rating value to 5, logs the updated company details, and saves the changes to the database. In the event of an error occurring during the company update process, the error is also diligently logged for future reference. This example illustrates how to efficiently manage and update multiple records within a specific context while handling potential errors gracefully.</description>
