      <description>The best way to learn how to use Slingr is to build something. Fortunately, we have made some tutorials to help you get started. In these tutorials, we wonâ€™t go through all the features of the platform. The goal is that you get a general idea of how it works, and then you can start building something great by yourself.
In these tutorials, we are going to assume you already have a developer account.</description>
